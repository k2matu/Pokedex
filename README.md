# Web Express Coding Challenge
The goal of this coding challenge is to put to work all the things students have learned during the WebDev workshops by building a Pokédex app.

The coding challenge needs to include:
A front end with at least 3 pages
User authentication (username and password)
An API
The use of and external API
A database
In the app people will be able to browse Pokémon, see various type of informations about these Pokémon and save their favourite ones.
Browsing the Pokémons should be available for anyone who visits the site, but a user should authenticate themselves (register, login) with a username and password to be able to save their favourites and see other peoples profiles with their favourite Pokémons.

User features
Register and login page(s) (username [unique] and password)
Passwords need to be stored encrypted (NO MD5)
If you’re feeling up to the challenge you can add email with email confirmation
A homepage with a list of pokemons
Check pagination or infinite scroll
You need to be able to sort the pokemons by name
If you are up to the challenge find other ways to sort them (number of likes for example) or group them by type and so on
A “search pokemon” feature
A “search user” feature (only authenticated users)
A page page where you can see more info about any pokemon
Obviously you don’t need 1 html file per pokemon
A user page where you can see the favourite pokemon of the user (only authenticated users)
A personal user page where the authenticated user can see their favouite pokemons and settings to change username and password
A way for the authenticated user to like and unlike a pokemon
Maybe even dislike and un-dislike
A Header a Main and a Footer

Logic
The page website should be safe from Javascript and SQL injections.
All external APIs calls should be made server side
All database queries should be made from the website’s API not form the frontend
