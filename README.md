# Web Express Coding Challenge
The goal of this coding challenge is to put to work all the things students have learned during the WebDev workshops by building a Pokédex app.

## The coding challenge needs to include:
1. A front end with at least 3 pages +
2. User authentication (username and password) +
3. An API +
4. The use of and external API +
5. A database +
6. In the app people will be able to browse Pokémon, see various type of informations about these Pokémon and save their favourite ones. +
7. Browsing the Pokémons should be available for anyone who visits the site, but a user should authenticate themselves (register, login) with a username and password to be able to save their favourites and see other peoples profiles with their favourite Pokémons. +

## User features
1. Register and login page(s) (username [unique] and password) +
2. Passwords need to be stored encrypted (NO MD5) +
3. If you’re feeling up to the challenge you can add email with email confirmation
4. A homepage with a list of pokemons +
5. Check pagination or infinite scroll +
6. You need to be able to sort the pokemons by name +
7. If you are up to the challenge find other ways to sort them (number of likes for example) or group them by type and so on +
8. A “search pokemon” feature +
9. A “search user” feature (only authenticated users) +
10. A page page where you can see more info about any pokemon +
11. A user page where you can see the favourite pokemon of the user (only authenticated users) +
12. A personal user page where the authenticated user can see their favouite pokemons and settings to change username and password +
13. A way for the authenticated user to like and unlike a pokemon. Maybe even dislike and un-dislike +
14. A Header a Main and a Footer +

## Logic
1. The page website should be safe from Javascript and SQL injections. +
2. All external APIs calls should be made server side +
3. All database queries should be made from the website’s API not form the frontend +
